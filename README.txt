== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I know what my “Event ID” is? =
Your event ID is a unique number that identifies your event.   You’ll need it to pull your event into WordPress.  You can grab it by logging into RSVPify, click your event, and copying and pasting the final number in the resulting URL (e.g. https://app.rsvpify.com/event/29321/)/

= What is a “shortcode”and what does it look like? =
In the WordPress world, a “shortcode” is a small snippet of text within brackets that effectively replace the need for long strings of code in your pages or posts — and allow you to easily include features and widgets offered by a plugin that you’ve installed in your pages and posts. Shortcodes are a small snippet of code within brackets: [myshortcode]


= I added the shortcode, but nothing is showing when I publish my page or post. Why? =
Is your website SSL-encrypted (using https:// rather than http://)? If so, ensure that you’ve changed the embed settings within your RSVPify dashboard to enable HTTPS. Learn more here.

= I see the shortcode on the page, but no RSVP form to speak of...? =
If you just see the [shortcode] on your page, but nothing is rendering, try to place the shortcode in the “Text” tab (rather than the “Visual” tab of your WordPress WYSIWYG editor.

= Is RSVPify free! =
Yup! RSVPify allows you to collect up to 100 RSVPs for free. Unlimited RSVPs and additional premium features are available with our paid plans.
